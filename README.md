In this app, the user enters a city into the search bar and then proceeds to click the search button. After the user has clicked the button, the city that they are looking up should proceed to fill the page. The app should show the current temerature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. Additionally, the page should also show a five day forecast below showing similar inforamtion.

Everytime a user searches for a different city, the page should show the new city and its current conditions, along with its five day forecast as well.

## WHAT DID I LEARN

Being able to call APIs is important in order to build a functioning app. With the help of Open Weather Map Data API, I as able to call the targeted information and then show it within the browser. I'm still learning and trying to enhance my skill, but unfortunately I was unable to complete all tasks required.
